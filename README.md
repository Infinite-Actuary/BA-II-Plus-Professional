# BA II Professional

### A list of helpful tips & tricks:
 
* [Increasing/Decreasing Annuity](http://www.actuarialoutpost.com/actuarial_discussion_forum/showthread.php?t=48035#3) - This method is a bit of a hack and you still need to divide through by the interest rate.

* [Compound Growth Annuity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEB-SG82lSM) - Much like calculating a normal Annuity but with a clever  trick at *t=60s*.

* [Bond Spreadsheet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Hhad_CAHg) - An example of calculating bond price `PRI` and accrued interest `AI` on a bond. Interest is accrued when the bond is sold between coupon payments. The BA II Plus uses the *Semi-Theoretical Method*.

* [Format Settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWajtj8ewn0) - Switch between Chain (`CHN`: operators are applied immediately with no precedence) and Algebraic Operating System (`AOS`: the expression is evaluated using [PEMDAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations)).
